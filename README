= Running =
== Golden Model ==
Execute in shell at repo root
```
    ./S_main_<platform>.exe RUN_test/input.py
```
Result will be stored in RUN_test Directory

= Tests =
Build and Run Golden Model
Use the comparison tool to compare the result
```
    python2.7 tool/generate_error.py RUN_test/golden.csv RUN_test/test.csv
```
Examine the resulting file result.csv, which contains the % error between each data points. It should display all zeros.
